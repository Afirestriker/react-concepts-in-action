# React Code Splitting

**Code splitting is crucial. It reduces the initial load time of your application.**

## What is Code Splitting in Routing?

- Code splitting in routing is a powerful technique to optimize your React applications.
- It's breaking down your appâ€™s routes into smaller chunks and loading them only when required.
- Your initial bundle size is smaller. You improve the performance of your application.
